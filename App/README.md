## Setup
#### Python Virtual Environment
In the `./water-conservation-prediction` parent folder, create a virtual environment in Python so we can keep track of libraries.  
To create a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv env

Where `env` is the name of your environment; however, if you choose something other than `env` you may need to update the `.gitignore` file.  

Now activate the virtual environment:  
**Windows**

    env\Scripts\activate.bat

**Unix or MacOS**

    source env/bin/activate
